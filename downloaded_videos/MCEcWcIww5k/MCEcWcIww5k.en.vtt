00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Wearing the clothes I bought for you
Wearing the perfume I gave you 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You’re probably smiling looking at her 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Was it that good, 
good enough to leave me? 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
How could I have done better? 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I want to forget about you 
but we spent too much time together 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The times that have passed by 
seems unfair and tears are falling 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I’ll show you a completely different me 
I’ll show you a prettier me

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I’m not going to cry for love or 
cry for you like I'm stupid

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I’ll meet a better man and show you,
that I'm happier than you

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I’m fine without you
I won’t give up, boy you gotta be aware 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I changed my hairstyle, put make-up on

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
High heels and short skirt, 
everyone is looking at me 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If I ever see you on the street

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I will smile and walk 
away from you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I’ll show you a completely different me 
I’ll show you a prettier me

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I’m not going to cry for love or 
cry for you like I'm stupid

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I’ll meet a better man and show you,
that I'm happier than you

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I’m fine without you, 
I won’t give up,boy you gotta be aware 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I’ll throw away the ring you gave me

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
get rid of the letters you wrote 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I’ll forget you without regret 
I will forget you, erase you 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I’ll show you a completely different me 
I’ll show you a prettier me

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I’m not going to cry for love or 
cry for you like I'm stupid

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I’ll meet a better man and show you,
that I'm happier than you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I’m fine without you, 
I won’t give up,boy you gotta be aware
