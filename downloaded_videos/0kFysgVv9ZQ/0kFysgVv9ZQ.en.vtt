00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.440
[Twice]

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.760
I'm in two minds, in an awkward situation

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.760
I just stare and say ba-ba-ba-baby

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.720
Every day I only imagine

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.200
Without asking, I speak casually and call your name baby

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.220
But we don't even know each other

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.100
Beautiful no matter what I wear

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.220
Just the two of us in the mirror having a

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.980

Nanananana

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.820
I start humming, and before I know it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.920
I feel like crying

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.360
I don't feel like myself, this isn't me at all

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.460
I love you so much

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.840
Think I'm all grown up now

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.560
[bang!]

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.680
I'm free to make my own choices, but why

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.360
Why can't I have it my own way

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.580
The more i try to push you away

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.300
The more I am drawn and attracted to you baby

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.600
I'm like TT

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.400
Just like TT

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.500
You don't know how I feel

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.240
You're so mean, You're so mean

Tell me that you'd be my baby

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.380
You say I'm ridiculous

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.200
That I don't live up to my looks

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.660
Doesn't cheer me up at all ba-ba-ba-baby

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.720
I'm going crazy

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.060
In all this mess, why do I feel hungry

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.820
I eat all day and I'm still hungry

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.100
slap slap slap the innocent doll

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.880
I sit and lie down all day, and time flies flies flies

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760
What's with the dull skin again

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Keep wanting to just complain

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.540
Mum keeps bothering me, why why why why why

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.220

I feel so irritated I'm so upset

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.320
I'm normally not like this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.580

Why can't I have it my way
