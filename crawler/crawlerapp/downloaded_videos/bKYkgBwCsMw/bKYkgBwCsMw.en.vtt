00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.080

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.940
So I had my boyfriend Daniel go and pick out a bunch of random stuff at the 99 cent store

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.320
And I'm going to try out these products that he found

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.500
And we're gonna see what they're all about

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.740
So with our further damn-a-do, let's dig in

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.440
and find out what's in this mysterious bag

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.900
Ha ha, okay

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.040
SO the first thing is the heck amazing play noodles

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.420
What the heck are these

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600
join together with no water, no glue

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.340
ooh this is kinda cool you can like build a house out of it and stuff

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.440
and like little butterflies

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.260
I've never seen these before

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.920
Are these just like a knock-off of something?

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.080
Ohhh there pretty. I kinda wanna eat them. Can I?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.700
Wait they actualy kind taste good

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.040
Oh there made of corn-starch and wheat flour and are harmless to the human body

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.400
Oh my gosh

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.540
There like starting to decompose

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.660
it kinda reminds me of a cheese puff ok get off my finger

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.140
uhhh ok let's just try this let's just grab a whole bunch of them and just clump them up together

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.580
there're not sticking together. Look, they're literally not.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.020
okay so it says, amazing noodle damp the sponge, wait you are supposed to damp it? I thought it says water is not included

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.000
join together.. oh WITH water

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.120
not without

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.760
okay

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.560
so that's why they're not sticking together

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.300
uhm, okay

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.640
well, lets try it, let's just use our tongue

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.000

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.100
red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.140
I don't know, the rainbow honestly such satisfying

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.080
such satisfying? That's not a right way

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.240
okay, so let's lick the red

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.420
it's starting to decompose

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.280
it's so weird

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.340
okay, these are just flying everywhere

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.660
I'm falling, help

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.980
okay, we'll lick the orange

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.420

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.060
I feel like I can make a whole video just on these

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.720
this is so crazy

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.780
and they kinda taste good too

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.460
I'm obsessed with these, GO 99 cents store

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.200
This could honestly be a YouTube video

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.620
Give this video a thumbs up with you want me to make this into a challenge

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.080

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.560
This is so cool,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.980

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.200
No? YES! YES! YES, kinda yes. Yes?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.600
Uhh? What do I even call?

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.740
Amazing play noodles

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.060
Oh my gosh! Okay, what is this?

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.440
I see Blow Pops, four scented nail polish???

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.200
Scented nail polish? I didn't even think that was even a thing

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.160
Oh my god-stoppers! ..or Oh my blow pop!

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.220
Oh wow!

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.720
Okay, this is exciting

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.900
I'm obviously going for the green one

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.800
..and it's sour apple scented? Holy Crap!

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.260
Okay, let's give it a good old sniff

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.840
this is..

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.980
This smells just like paint

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.780
Doesn't it just smell like paint?

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.380
I know, you're welcome.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.880
Okay, hold up

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.340
So maybe that's just the green one

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.240
I'm gonna give 99 cents store the benefit of doubt

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.360
and we're gonna try the red one

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.700
it's supposed to be cherry

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.000
i mean, i don't think it's supposed to smell

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.620
no

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.040
it's the exact same as the green

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.780
uhh, okay

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.960
but if you think about it

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.580
alot of these kids' toys are not supposed to smell good

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.340
because it would make kids want to eat it

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.060
so let's try the purple

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.560
they literally all smell the same

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.580
actually this one kinda smells, oh my gosh that one does have a grape smell

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.040
okay, alright

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.980
cool

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.520
I'm not gonna try putting these on my nails

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.340
because I can already tell it's gonna be a disaster

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.440
alright, let's try the pink one

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.120
okay, this one actually just start to make my mouth water

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.820
I want to lick it but its definitely toxic

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.980
Let's see what else is in this great old bag of goodies

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.320
this is exciting

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.820
honestly, this is the best day of my life

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.080
they have a Nerds flavor too??

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.200
Oh my gosh

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.300
okay, we can't get into this, they're probably the same exact thing, so,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.740
what the heck? scented nail polish?

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.020
that's not actually scented

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.200
candy powder filled plastic carrots

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.240
What kinda powder is this?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.420
we're gonna try it

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.520
Let's see

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.960
Alright, is it literally just a carrot filled with sugar?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.640
I'm pretty sure that's what it is

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.400
okay, we're just gonna unscrew this carrot

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.080
What the heck is in here...

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.380
I don't know if I trust this

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.780
is this like poison powder?

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.260
just gonna give it a little lick

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.080
oh my god.....!

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.160
That is actually really freaking sour

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.660
What the heck is this carrot thing???

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.120
I... alright, you know what, I'm just gonna go for it

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.760
yup, ooooh

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.960
Damm, that's a sour carrot

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.680
Alright, carrot from the dollar store

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.680
That's taking something healthy and turning it very unhealthy

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.340
hmm, wouldn't have expected that from the dollar store

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.840
What the heck? OKE Aloe?

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.340
Artificially peach flavored drink

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.360
Artificially flavored?

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.240
That's their promo

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.440
Artificially flavored, that's really good for you

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.440
Oh my.. eww, there's chunks of something in here

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.520
uhh, when does this expires?

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.280
Let's first look at that

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.660
because that concerns me that there's chunks

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.720
hello? where's your expiration date?

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.500
Oh, it's right here

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.160
Wait, I'm really confused

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.500
It says 'expires 25th of Nov 2001 BC'

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.420
2001 before Christ?

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.380
WHAT!?

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.540
That's really confusing

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.720
oh made 2016 Nov 03

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.960
I don't know what this means

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.180
expiration 25 Nov 2018

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.600
What the heck? okay

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.000
I'm just gonna go for it

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.060
Oh, you know what?

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.680
It just taste like a peach ring

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.980
like a candy peach ring

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.780
It's actually kinda good but it taste just like candy

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.360
it taste like a candy drink

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.240
This is not healthy

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.800
definitely not healthy

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.120
okay, honestly,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.520

but it kinda scares me it's only a dollar

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.200
is my hand gonna fall off and explode?

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.080

then indicate direction until popper injects confetti

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.860

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.860
oh my god! It's a warning

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.420
This is not a toy!

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.280
Keep out of reach of children

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.120
Always direct away from persons, animals, and objects

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.100
never point towards your face and eyes

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.520
okay, oh my gosh

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.020
this is terrifying

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.900
okay

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.780
