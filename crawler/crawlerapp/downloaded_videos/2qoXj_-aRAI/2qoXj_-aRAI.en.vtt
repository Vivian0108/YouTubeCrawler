00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.390
So here's a more challenging quiz about find. This one will require you

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.170
to think pretty carefully about how find is defined. For any string, so

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.110
we're going to have a variable s that we've initialized to any string. Your

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.940
goal is to determine which of these will always have the value zero.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.840
So the first choice, s.find (s). Notice there are no quotes around s. The

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.090
second one is s.find('s'). The third one is

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.295
's'.find('s'). The fourth one is

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:39.930
s.find(''). And the final

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.840
one is s.find Passing

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.130
in s concatenated with the string. Three exclamation points, one of my favorites

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.368
plus one. So check all of the answers where the expression here

00:00:58.368 --> 00:01:05.390
evaluates to zero, no matter what value the string s starts with. So try

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.450
to answer this, just based on thinking, understanding the description of find.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.890
You can always also try things in the Python interpreter

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.560
after that. And see if your interpretation is correct. But remember

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.170
our goal is to answer the question where no matter

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.170
what the string S is, the resultive expression is always zero.
