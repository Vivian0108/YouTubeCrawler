00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
Hey guys!

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.320
It's Rachel.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.785
So a while back I did
testing out weird dog gadgets

00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:05.434
with Neyo, who is my puppy.

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:06.975
Which was really
fun because I didn't

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.926
know how many weird
gadgets were made for dogs.

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.050
So then it got me thinking.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.405
How many weird gadgets
are made for people?

00:00:13.405 --> 00:00:14.030
A lot, I think.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.155
I think a lot of weird
gadgets are made for people.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.080
And I was right,
because, wow, I found

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.500
some really gadgets for this.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.910
So, for this video
I'm going to do

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.270
trying out weird girl gadgets.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.210
To be honest, I think
it was unnecessary these

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.949
were gendered objects,
because they're objects.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:31.490
But whatever.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.531
These were just that were
marketed towards girls,

00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:35.280
so I'll do testing
out girl gadgets.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.863
And give this video
a thumbs up if you

00:00:36.863 --> 00:00:39.988
want to see me testing out weird
guy gadgets, because it's even

00:00:39.988 --> 00:00:41.380
weirder when it's for guys.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.145
Ugh.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:44.186
And comment down below
which one of these gadgets

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:45.630
you would actually use.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.160
So without further ado,
let's get on with the video.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.850
Weird gadget number one.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.060
This thing basically
is supposedly something

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.180
that you put on your head,
and it moves the ears

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.840
based on your emotions.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.044
But we'll see.

00:01:02.044 --> 00:01:04.028
Lost an ear.

00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:06.350
I think that's supposed
to go here, like that,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.554
just a little behind my head.

00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:11.999
Are these supposed
to go on my ear?

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:15.082
Can I press this button?

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:18.760
It feels so weird!

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.160
Is the motion it's
showing uncomfortable?

00:01:24.848 --> 00:01:27.300
I'm going to just try
to see if this works.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.380
So the first emotion
I will do is happy.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.670
I'll first do happy and we'll
see if the ears go to happy.

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:48.400
Are these sad ears?

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.526
Wow, imagine if my ears
just moved this much.

00:01:57.526 --> 00:01:59.260
I wish I had knew how
to wiggle my ears.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.993
Let me try.

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.630
Fine, I may not be able
to wiggle my actual ears,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.900
but I can wiggle these ears.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.280
I can't but feel like
this is just randomized.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.380
OK, I'll feel nothing.

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:25.910
Yeah, no, I don't
think this thing works.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.438
I wonder if it moves even
when it's not on my head.

00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:31.839
Oh my god, there
must be a ghost here!

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.630
I am just kidding this
house isn't haunted.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.810
This next girl gadget
is, a remote control

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.470
mop because only
girls clean, right?

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.220
I'm joking.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.141
But it is that it's
a remote control map.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.682
OK, I'm going to
try it on the couch.

00:02:51.618 --> 00:02:53.106
Let's try it on the floor.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:56.890
OK, this is literally a toy car
with a little mop around it,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.770
but let's try it
out on the floor.

00:03:03.942 --> 00:03:04.650
Oh, look at that!

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.860
It goes in a little circle!

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.570
Wow!

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.382
I'll never have
to mop ever again.

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:14.846
Oh!

00:03:14.846 --> 00:03:15.346
Neyo!

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:23.744
Oh my god, it fits
under my couch!

00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:25.720
I think I broke it.

00:03:35.895 --> 00:03:38.450
It was fun it lasted.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.650
The next weird gadget is a
full leg and foot massager.

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:51.133
OK.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.664
Oh my goodness, it's
like a little dog petter.

00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:07.652
Hey, cutie.

00:04:07.652 --> 00:04:09.134
How do I start it?

00:04:09.134 --> 00:04:10.616
This is all in Japanese.

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:12.592
I don't fully understand.

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:25.090
It just kind of feels like--
you know when you get your blood

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.738
pressure taken by the doctor?

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:29.357
It's not unpleasant.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.200
This is weird!

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.108
I don't want to tear it off!

00:04:41.878 --> 00:04:43.660
I'm good now.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.400
The next one has a lot of wires.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.910
This one is supposed
to be a microphone

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.764
that you can sing karaoke
into where nobody hears you.

00:04:52.764 --> 00:04:56.020
So when you're having a
3:00 AM karaoke session--

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.966
this is when you'd use that.

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:01.360
I think the whole point is
that I can hear myself sing,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.460
but no one else can.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.930
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.085
OK, let's see.

00:05:10.085 --> 00:05:11.570
Hello?

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.540
OK, so I'd be able to sing,
and no one else can hear me.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.530
Can you guys hear me?

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.005
Can you guys hear me right now?

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:21.470
I believe I can fly!

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.450
[MUFFLED SINGING]

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.575
Can you hear me singing,
because I can hear

00:05:27.575 --> 00:05:28.895
myself singing really loud.

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.875
[VOCALIZING]

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.350
Hello!

00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:38.230
OK.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.710
I can't help thinking about you.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.940
I hear that in my head.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.420
OK, so I get it,
you sing with it.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.551
I just want you.

00:05:49.551 --> 00:05:51.990
Just can't be--

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.694
Try to guess what I'm saying
in the comment section.

00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:57.585
Susie bought seashells
down by the seashore.

00:05:57.585 --> 00:06:02.027
[MUFFLED SINGING] you might
have to lift the gate.

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:06.518
But don't worry, be happy.

00:06:06.518 --> 00:06:08.912
I feel you guys could
still completely hear

00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:10.400
what I'm saying.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.320
This next gadget--
it's a special massager

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.340
that helps shape and tone
your bust into a better form.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.385
That's not a real thing.

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:22.220
You can't shape and
tone it with a hand.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.230
To be honest, the
last thing that I want

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.980
is to have a creepy
shaped hand as something

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.010
that holds my boob.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:36.611
It feels like a weird
bathing suit or a weird bra.

00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:40.160
Supportive, it gives support.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.470
If you agonize about
sagging bust, don't worry,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.420
you're not alone.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.470
OK, first of all, let
me just say something.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.055
A boob is a boob, and
every boob is lovely, OK?

00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:52.430
I don't like this whole thing
where some people are like,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.690
oh yeah, some boobs are
saggy, or that these boobs are

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.481
really flat, or these
boobs are really big.

00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:58.610
Let girls just have boobs!

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.455
I don't think does
what it says it does,

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:05.860
but it's a great backscratcher,
root lifter, if you're lonely,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.890
you can hold another hand.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.000
It can also probably apply
some under eye concealer

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.050
pretty well.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.384
You can use it to
place a hand on a knee.

00:07:15.384 --> 00:07:17.000
You can use it for
lots of things,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.803
just not what it says it's for.

00:07:18.803 --> 00:07:23.210
This next gadget is
an aluminum face spa.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.050
I think it's just a face
mask made out of aluminum?

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.625
Put this behind my ears.

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:31.050
What's here, this
behind my neck, I think?

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.330
No.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.400
Yeah.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.840
Yeah, you're supposed to
use this in the shower.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.680
I guess it does is--

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.610
puts the steam on your face,
but I'm getting steam on my face

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.552
just from me breathing on
myself, because the air doesn't

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:50.052
come out.

00:07:55.908 --> 00:08:00.440
I feel like, a super
fancy jousting person.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.370
I'm going to go to
a renaissance fair

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.110
but be the fabulous knight.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.920
Ooh, yeah I'm sweaty now.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.520
And then there's this thing.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.553
I think it's supposed to
strengthen your cheek muscles.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.738
I feel like it would be fun
to eat food with this on.

00:08:36.188 --> 00:08:37.059
That was weird.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.682
This next gadget is similar
to the remote control

00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:47.140
mop, except for I think this
mop you just put on the floor,

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.820
and it just laughs.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.440
OK.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.866
Ah!

00:08:59.866 --> 00:09:04.506
OK, so it just moves
around on it's own.

00:09:04.506 --> 00:09:05.006
Uh!

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.355
I can't see this getting
much done to be honest.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.506
But it's cute.

00:09:21.506 --> 00:09:24.050
It's definitely cute.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.880
It's useless though,
completely useless.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.040
But, yeah!

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.540
That's all the gadgets.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.230
