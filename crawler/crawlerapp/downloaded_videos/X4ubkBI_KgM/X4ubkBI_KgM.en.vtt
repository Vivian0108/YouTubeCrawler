"Heavy Metal Urine Testing
and Chelation for Autism"

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.280
Environmental risk factors,
meaning non-genetic risk factors,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.440
may play a significant role in autism,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.500
given the fact that even identical twins

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.210
that share the same DNA may not share

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.640
the disease more than half the time.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.730
A variety of risk factors 
have been proposed:

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.670
lead, mercury, persistent 
organic pollutants

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.040
like PCBs, or birth complications

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.840
might cause a pro-inflammatory state

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.900
and oxidative damage in the brain.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.320
But, what’s that based on?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.800
You see a lot of correlational 
studies like this,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.870
speculating about the possibility
that one of the hidden agents

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.940
spurring the rise in autism

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.190
is something within the food supply,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.260
especially industrialized meat production,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.060
particularly poultry,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.100
based on the fact that
the rise in poultry consumption,

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.239
particularly parental poultry consumption,

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.120
appeared to correlate with
the rise in autism.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.260
They suggest it’s the 
massive contamination

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.420
of meat with antibiotics, growth
hormones, and toxic pollutants,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.060
such as dioxin in the meat.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390
There’s certainly toxicological issues

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.580
associated with meat production,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.840
not just the pollutants

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.479
but the cooked meat
carcinogens, leukotoxins.

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.509
This review in the journal Meat Science

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.070
came up with a whole list.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.960
But, if anything, the main chronic toxic

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.280
response of consuming 
meat and meat products

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.890
is cancer, not autism.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.729
There’s tons of confounding factors

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.520
that could explain this correlation.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.719
Same thing with fish 
consumption and autism.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.820
On a state by state level, mercury-related

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.330
fish advisories were found to be

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.500
a surprisingly strong
predictor of autism rates,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.880
suggesting that mercury
contaminated fish was to blame,

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.820
but how many people tend to even eat

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.670
the fish from their own state?

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.340
That in no way proves a cause and effect

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.880
mercury-autism connection.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.829
Why would they even think
to make that connection?

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.030
Well, heavy metals, like mercury and lead,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.249
do cause brain damage,

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.579
and there’s some similarities

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.929
in terms of the symptoms
they can cause,

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.260
but you don’t really know...

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.290
until you put it to the test.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.160
“Urine mobilization test,”
“challenge test,” or

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.480
“provoked urine test” are all terms

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.050
used to describe the administration

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.100
of a chelating agent—
a heavy metal binding agent—

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.700
to a person prior to the collection

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.340
of their urine to test to see the level

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.490
of heavy metal burden within their bodies.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.430
But, pediatric, public health,
and toxicology authorities

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.490
recommend against 
the use of these tests,

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.790
based on a lack of scientific validation

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.390
and a lack of demonstrated benefits

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.750
to the patients.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.530
Usually promoted by 
alternative practitioners

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.720
as the basis for recommending,
promoting, and selling

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.240
to the patient questionable and
often inappropriate therapies

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.840
supposedly aimed at “detoxification.”

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.380
Despite this disapproval,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.510
the tests are still commonly used

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.210
and recommended by some practitioners.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.940
This is what the results
end up looking like.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.920
Uh oh, looks like mercury is in the red.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.970
It’s easy for uninformed 
patients and providers

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.750
to infer that a result that falls

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.380
in the yellow or red background

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.730
signifies heavy metal poisoning,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.430
but that’s because they’re not
reading the fine print.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.380
That reference interval, 
that normal green range,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.120
is the level under 
non-provoked conditions,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.430
meaning normal urine,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.790
not urine from someone 
who was just given

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.150
a chelating drug to provoke the response,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.930
to intentionally grab onto heavy metals

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.150
in the body and pull them into the urine.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.430
That’s like giving someone a drug

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.490
that raises their heart rate—
like a shot of adrenaline,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.980
then taking their pulse, and being,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.960
“Like wow, you got an 
abnormally high heart rate!”

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.780
Compared to other people who just
got a shot of adrenaline?

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.520
No, just compared to a
regular resting heart rate.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.560
Well, duh.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.010
See, there's no established

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.720
reference ranges for 
provoked urine samples;

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.520
so, they’re using the 
wrong reference range.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.980
So, we have no idea 
what the results mean,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.940
and given the potential 
harm of whatever treatment

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.220
a practitioner then tries to sell you on,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.620
these tests should not be utilized.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.120
Most commonly, that treatment
means chronic chelation therapy.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.810
A half million people with autism

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.240
are subjected to chelation
therapy in the U.S. every year,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.600
despite no clinical trial evidence

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.070
suggesting there’s any benefit.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.820
Why not just give it a try though?

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.060
Because there’s potential for side effects,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.640
like death.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.720
They’re referring to this case,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.030
where doctors were like oops,
they just gave the wrong drug.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.720
Should have been given
edetate calcium disodium,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.010
not just straight edetate disodium.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.560
But this may have been no accident.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.900
That’s exactly what’s recommended
by leading chelation proponents.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.320
As such, it would have been surprising

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.080
only if the practitioner had not chosen it.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.090
So, this may not just be a simple matter

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.840
of the “wrong medication 
being administered.”

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.320
That may just be a distraction from

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.820
the prospect that the killer was quackery.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.840
This is not to say that
heavy metals aren’t toxic.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.320
It’s just that instead of trying

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.310
to give people chelation
drugs after the fact,

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.639
we should try to not get
exposed in the first place.

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.470
For example, in this study, they compared

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.620
the blood mercury levels of
physicians who ate no fish,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.840
compared to those who ate 
1 or 2 servings a week,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.650
compared to those who ate 3 or more.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.690
Here’s where the 3 or more servings

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.850
a week group started out,

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.850
and after a single chelation drug dose,

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.020
mercury levels dropped down to here,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.270
but perhaps better to eat less fish,

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.080
or no fish at all.
